description: 
'Adrift is a short VFX film I created as a solo project. The aim of the project was to create a short visual effects sequence involving a live action character within a CG environment. This comes with many challenges and is something that is frequently done in films and VFX. I chose to do this project as it provided me with the opportunity to challenge myself and solve many of the problems that occur in the VFX industry. I enjoy watching science fiction films and I find them interesting as we get to see and explore new ideas and concepts most people do not see within everyday life. Films such as: Interstellar and Gravity use visual effects to help tell their story and they are sometimes indistinguishable from what is real. These are the films that I am passionate about and it is the reason why I have chosen to create a live action short sequence based on an astronaut stranded in space.'
