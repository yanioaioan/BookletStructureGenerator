description: 
'G-Minor is a short film about the piano. A film in G-minor. The piece depicts a piano, in an abandoned cathedral, playing itself in the emotionally poignant key of G-minor. Inspired by the closing piano scene of Your Lie In April - an anime close to my heart. It showcases my modelling abilities, as well as my skills as a director and a composer of music.'
