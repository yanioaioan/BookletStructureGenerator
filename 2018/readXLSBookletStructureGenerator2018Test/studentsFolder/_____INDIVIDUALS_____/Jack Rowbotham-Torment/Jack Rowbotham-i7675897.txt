description: 
'Torment is a CG short film created by myself that portrays a cars escape from brutality and torture; endured through its time in captivity. Taking inspiration from Stephen Kings Christine, my goal was to create a visual piece adhering to both cinematic and commercial conventions, personifying and injecting life into the subject of a car with a technical emphasis on lighting and effects. I used this project to test myself and push my limits of what could be achieved alone; stepping out of my comfort zone and learning new skills and techniques to create a visually entertaining piece.
