description: 
'I have created Matte Paintings where I was inspired by surrealism and influenced by art of a fantastical nature; My goal was to create my own images that held these qualities but that can also be featured in film as backgrounds.\nIn addition,  I have created an office space in which the aim was to design an interior space, where realistic renders should be the final result, Maya/Vray and Photoshop in post; helped achieve this result.\nWith motivation and hard work I believe I was able to push my art to a higher standard. \n'
