description: 
"Spaghettify' is a 3D animated, Sci-fi/Comedy short starring Kevin, a layabout slob who lives alone in a filthy apartment. One night, when trying to reheat a spaghetti dinner, he leaves a metal fork in the microwave and subsequently rips a hole in time and space.  What follows is a hilarious, pasta filled thrill ride for all-ages. "
