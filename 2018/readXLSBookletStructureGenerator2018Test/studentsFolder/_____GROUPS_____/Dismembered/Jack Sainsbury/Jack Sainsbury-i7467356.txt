description: 
'"Dismembered" was our attempt to recreate the look and feel of a dark fantasy game, with a humorous twist. Play as "the Graverobber" as he gains the ability to swap limbs with the dead, and fights to free his new friend, "the Shadow", a world-ending evil spirit, who was sealed away for a very good reason.'
