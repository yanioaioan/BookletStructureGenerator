description: 
'Somnia is an abstract music video created in full CG, with a motion captured dancer. A headless lady moves through her repetitious daily life as the surrounding world comes alive around her. With heavy influence from contemporary artists such as Bonobo and Jon Hopkins. Through a combination of subtle FX and realistic environments we created a believable world and an engaging sequence - pushing what the three of us could produce in both quality and quantity.'
