description: 
'"""My project is a short live action film, which showcases the  possible hallucinogenic experiences of a drug addict. Also. how an unbreakable loop of addiction might be created as a result of drug usage. During the project I mainly focused on creating believable visual effects, which would then had to transition to the abstract hallucinogenic sequence made out of constantly changing fractal geometry.\n""\n"'
